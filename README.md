## Features

- Captures WPA/WPA2 EAPOL 4-way handshakes
- Saves captured data in PCAP format
- Web interface to download handshakes
- Portable and lightweight with ESP32
- Passive monitoring (no injection required)
- Works with tools like Wireshark, Aircrack-ng, Hashcat (after conversion)

---

## Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board (e.g., DevKit v1)
- USB cable (Micro-USB or USB-C depending on your board)
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
- WiFi network you are authorized to test

---

## Flashing Instructions

### Option 1: Arduino IDE

1. Install ESP32 board support:
   - File → Preferences → Additional Board URLs:
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
2. Open Boards Manager and install "ESP32"
3. Load `esp32-handshake-capture.ino`
4. Select:
   - Board: ESP32 Dev Module
   - Port: Your correct COM/tty port
5. Click "Upload"

### Option 2: PlatformIO (VS Code)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arvat/esp32-handshake-capture.git
cd esp32-handshake-capture
pio run --target upload
```

---

## Running the Tool

1. Open a serial monitor at 115200 baud.
2. The ESP32 will scan for nearby WiFi networks.
3. Select the target network by its SSID/BSSID.
4. The handshake is captured passively.
5. ESP32 saves the handshake as a `.pcap` file.
6. Connect to the ESP32's web interface to download the capture.

---

## Output

Captured handshakes are stored in `.pcap` format and compatible with:
- Wireshark
- aircrack-ng
- hcxpcapngtool / hashcat

---
